# 🎵 Personal Music Information Management System (PMIMS)

A simple and powerful music management web application for storing, searching, and organizing personal music collections. Built as part of my Final Year Project at Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR), this system aims to provide a lightweight, user-friendly platform with fuzzy search capabilities and a modern UI.

# Remarks

I got a B grade in this project.
My Entire Final Year Project is huge that involving interaction with front-end and back-end as well as the MySQL database.
The original version was a full-stack system that supported fuzzy search and server-side music management. This version removes backend/database interaction and focuses solely on smooth UI/UX and native performance. So I decided to modify into one framework (React Native) to run the partial music application.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 **Fuzzy Search** for songs and artists using Levenshtein distance (Not included)
- 🎨 Modern UI built with React (music app style)
- 💽 Backend powered by Java (Spring Boot) - (Not included)
- 🗂️ MySQL database integration for persistent data storage - (Not included)
- 💾 Add to Favorites & Playlist functionality - (Not included)
- 📁 Download feature for local audio storage 
- 📱 Responsive design (mobile-friendly) - (Not included)
